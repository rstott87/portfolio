            <p>Iâ€™m a front-end web developer in Boston with a focus on creating things that aid in learning and problem solving.
            My philosophy centers on designing UIs that demonstrate, visualize, and simplify complex concepts 
            through basic user engagement. The majority of this work 
            is done in React and CSS.

                In the Winter of 2022, I completed a full-time six month web development program
                at Bloom Institute of Technology which was one of the most challenging but also most rewarding 
                experiences in my software development journey.
