            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m a front-end web developer out of Boston, MA. In my personal experience, learning is best done in a hands-on interactive 
            environment. With that in mind, a lot of my work focuses on
            designing and building UIs that demonstrate, visualize, and simplify more complex concepts 
            through basic user interactions. The majority of this work 
            is done using only React and CSS. 
            </p> 
             <p> <br></br>
                In the Winter of 2022, I completed a full-time six month web development program
                at Bloom Institute of Technology which was one of the most challenging but also most rewarding 
                experiences in my software development journey.
